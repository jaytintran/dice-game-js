The game consists of a single page that is designed using HTML and styled with CSS.
The page includes an interactive dice that can be rolled by clicking a button or pressing a keyboard key.
The dice has multiple sides, each with a different number from 1 to 6.
When the dice is rolled, a random number is generated and displayed on the dice.
The game also includes a score counter that keeps track of the total score for each roll.
The game has a reset button that allows players to start a new game.
The game is implemented using JavaScript, which handles the logic for rolling the dice, updating the score, and resetting the game.
